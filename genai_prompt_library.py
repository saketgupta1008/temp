    Effective Prompt Guide for Summarization

    This guide provides best practices for creating effective prompts to achieve high-quality summaries 
    using machine learning models or generative AI tools. Summarization is the process of distilling 
    information from a larger text while retaining its essential meaning and context. Here are the steps 
    and tips to create effective summarization prompts:

    1. **Be Clear and Specific**: 
       - Start your prompt with a clear instruction. For example, "Summarize the following text" 
         or "Provide a brief overview of the main points in this article."

    2. **Set Length Constraints**: 
       - Specify the desired length of the summary. For example, "Summarize in 2-3 sentences" 
         or "Provide a summary in bullet points."

    3. **Provide Context**: 
       - If applicable, give some context about the text being summarized. This could be 
         a brief description of the source or its significance.

    4. **Include Keywords**: 
       - Mention any key concepts or terms that should be included in the summary. For example, 
         "Make sure to include the author's main argument and any significant findings."

    5. **Use Examples**: 
       - If you have examples of desired summaries, include them in your prompt. This helps the model 
         understand the format and style you are looking for.

    6. **Iterate and Refine**: 
       - After generating a summary, review it and refine your prompt based on the output. 
         If necessary, provide additional guidance or constraints to improve the results.

    **Example Prompts**:
    - "Summarize the following article in 3 sentences, focusing on the main argument and supporting evidence."
    - "Provide a bullet-point summary of this research paper, highlighting the key findings and their implications."
