In my role as an ML Engineer at Barclays, I consistently drive simplicity and efficiency by automating manual tasks and processes, particularly within the Generative AI (GenAI) pipeline. One key area I’ve focused on is Automating Data Visualization, which is critical when working with large language models (LLMs). Given that the effectiveness of any LLM is heavily dependent on data quality, I’ve implemented robust logic to ensure data integrity while minimizing human intervention, using automated checks and validations.
To further streamline complex tasks, I utilized AWS Lambda and other cloud services to automate the creation of vector databases such as PGvector and knowledge bases. By using CloudFormation templates, I simplified the process of provisioning these databases, reducing manual setup time and ensuring consistency. This automation has played a critical role in managing large volumes of data efficiently, which is key for tasks involving LLMs and other data-intensive applications.
For each task, I make sure to follow best practices in code writing and solution maintenance, ensuring scalability and reliability. During my work on "Statistics as a Service," I leveraged reliable data sources and automated processes to deliver consistent and accurate results, improving the overall efficiency and reliability of the service.
Beyond my technical contributions, I applied these principles to competitions like AWS DeepRacer, where I employed optimized strategies that helped our team secure the 1st runner-up position. This demonstrates my ability to implement streamlined and efficient solutions across both technical projects and competitive challenges.
Through automation and simplification, I have consistently contributed to improving products and services by reducing manual effort, ensuring data accuracy, and delivering reliable outcomes for the organization.


As part of the COE team for GenAI, my focus has been on leading the development of strategic projects that are expected to drive long-term value for the bank. One of my key initiatives has been the development of a tool under the Statistics as a Service (STaaS) framework, which aims to help different business units better interpret and utilize data. While this tool is still in development, it is designed to enable teams to make more informed, data-driven decisions, improving operational efficiency and aligning with the bank’s strategic objectives.
This tool will play a crucial role in helping us understand human spending patterns and consumer psychology, providing insights that will allow us to optimize our products and services. By leveraging data in this way, we can identify key opportunities to enhance business performance and meet client needs more effectively.
Although the product is still under development, I have ensured that it is built with scalability and long-term impact in mind. Once launched, it will contribute significantly to strengthening client relationships, improving our product offerings, and supporting the bank’s broader objective of leveraging data for business growth.
